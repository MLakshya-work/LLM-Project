# Cold Email Generator for Service Companies

This Cold Email Generator leverages GROQ, LangChain, and Streamlit to streamline the process of generating personalized cold emails for service companies. It allows users to input the URL of a company's careers page, extract job listings from that page, and create customized cold emails. These emails include relevant portfolio links, sourced from a vector database, based on the specific job descriptions.

**Use Case:**

For example, Any Company is searching for any job role and investing significant time and resources in hiring, onboarding, and training. Atliq, a software development company, can offer Nike a dedicated software engineer to fulfill this role. The business development executive from Atliq, Lakshya, will reach out to Nike via a cold email, generated by this tool, offering their services.
